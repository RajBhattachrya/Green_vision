# **Green Vision**

Green Vision is a Python-based project that combines computer vision and sustainability insights.
It leverages machine learning models (via Jupyter notebooks) and a simple web interface (app.py) to demonstrate how AI can be applied to green initiatives.


# **🚀 Features**

📊 Interactive Jupyter notebooks for experimentation

🖼️ Computer vision models (image classification / object detection)

🌍 Focus on sustainable applications (e.g., waste detection, plant health, eco-vision use cases)

💻 Web interface using Flask (with templates/)

⚡ Easy setup with requirements.txt
